# Rent My Tent
> A peer-to-peer marketplace for used tents. Sell your tent. Hire a tent.

## Motivation
Often people purchase tents with only a single-use in mind. This means we have many tents, yet little utility. :angry:

In the UK its a particular problem at music festivals where [250,000 tents get left behind every year.](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/festivals-2019-tent-ban-single-use-plastic-waste-pollution-aif-a8904216.html) This becomes nearly 900 tonnes of plastic waste, most of which ends up in landfill.

Tents are multi-material - nylon, metal, plastic etc., so practically impossible to recycle. The average tent weighs 3.5kg and is mostly made of plastic - the equivalent of 8750 straws.

## User Stories
* Toby  (see Toby's user persona on [Milanote](https://app.milanote.com/1J9Phh1KiYulbj))
  - As a tent owner I want to sell my tent so that I can get some money back for it whilst ensuring its put to good use / responsibly used.
* Rachel  (see Rachel's user persona on [Milanote](https://app.milanote.com/1J9Pro1KiYulbl))
  - As someone in the market for a tent I'd rather rent than own a tent, to save money and to depend on less stuff.

## System Overview
Once a tent is added to the marketplace it will always be available for rent; except during rental periods when the tent is being used by the renter.

## Week One
* Why is blockchain needed to solve this problem?
  - Public blockchain infrastructure is well-suited to freely create and exchange unique digital representations of physical items - in our case - tents!
* What demographics do you serve?
  - 250,000 tents are left at music festivals across the UK every year. Source: Association of Independent Festivals.
  - [Atomik Research](https://www.atomikresearch.co.uk/survey-finds-2000000-worth-of-tents-and-sleeping-bags-abandoned-each-year/) found that music fans take £795 of camping gear to festivals leave £200's worth behind.
* What is the size of the market?
* What other solutions are currently being used to address this problem?
* What are the geopolitical, cultural-social-economic factors that must be taken into consideration?
  - Calls to ban retailers from selling "single-use" tents.
  - In a recent festival-goer-survey, 12% of respondents said they thought that a left tent would go to charity. It doesn’t.
  - Festival goers becoming more mindful in recent years.
  - Glastonbury claim that 99.3% of tents we're taken home last year. They've been asking attendees to adhere to the ‘Love The Farm, Leave No Trace’ pledge and leave their campsite as they found it.
* What are some nuances and complexities that must be addressed?
  - Bootstrapping a two-sided marketplace - the classic chicken & egg problem.
  - Trust.
  - Market dynamics.
  - Messaging.
