# Rent My Tent
> A marketplace for used tents 

## Motivation
Often people purchase tents with only a single-use in mind. This means we have many tents, yet little utility. :angry:

## System Overview
Once a tent is added to the marketplace it will always be available for rent; except during rental periods when the tent is being used by the renter.
