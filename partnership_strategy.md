## Partnership strategy

We can offer a seamless way for festivals to earn a commision on all of the tent sales which originate from their festival. To do this we’ll use the geotag embedded in the tent images that get uploaded for Rent My Tent marketplace listings.

So when someone lists their tent on Rent My Tent we can keep a record of the place that they took the photo of the tent.

Where the _image origin_ falls within the festival grounds (geofence) we’ll be able to allocate commission to the festival once the tent has its first transaction on Rent My Tent.

This partnership program is a low-friction and easily trackable way for festivals, and any physical venue (that can provide a geofence), to earn commissions by promoting Rent My Tent to their customers.

Much like [Brave Rewards](https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/), commissions can be allocated even before festivals have signed up to the program.
