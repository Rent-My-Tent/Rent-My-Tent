## Partnership strategy

We can offer a seamless way for festivals to earn a commision on all of the tent sales which originate from their festival. To do this we’ll use the geotag that is embedded in the tent images that get uploaded for Rent My Tent marketplace listings.

Where the image origin falls within the festival grounds (geofence) we’ll be able to allocate commission to the festival once the tent has its first transaction on Rent My Tent.

This partnership program is a low-friction and easily trackable way for festivals, and any physical venue (that can provide a geofence), to earn commissions from their own promotional efforts.

Much like Brave Rewards, commissions can be allocated before festivals have signed up to the program.
