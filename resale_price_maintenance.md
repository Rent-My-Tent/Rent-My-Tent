## What is resale price maintenance?

[Wikipedia definition:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resale_price_maintenance)
> _Resale price maintenance is the practice whereby a manufacturer and its distributors agree that the distributors will sell the manufacturer's product at certain prices, at or above a price floor or at or below a price ceiling. Resale price maintenance prevents resellers from competing too fiercely on price, especially with regard to fungible goods._

This practice can help secure margins for resellers and ensure sound quality isn’t driven out of the market.

## Why does Rent My Tent need a form of resale price maintenance?

The initial incentive for tent sellers lies in it being easy to sell their tent and getting a fair price for doing so.

Online marketplaces can get flooded with low value items / listings, this has been a problem for Fiverr. If it becomes hard to get a fair price for the tent you own, the economics won’t incentivise the selling and rental behaviours we need for the market to function.

> **Rent My Tent will prevent this problem with its own form of resale price maintenance.**

When tent sellers go through the tent listing process they’ll have to accept that they can’t list their tent below the floor price that Rent My Tent sets.

The combination of resale price maintenance and the deposit return scheme will incentivise people to take good care of the tents they hire, ensuring tents retain value and the provisions of the marketplace are upheld.

The economics behind resale price maintenance and deposit return schemes, will fuel the reuse of tents and the ongoing health of the Rent My Tent marketplace facilitating it.

## What does it look like in practice?

When Toby comes to Rent My Tent to sell his tent he goes through the listing process where he enters some details about his tent and uploads some photos of when it was last used. Next he sets the price of his tent. Rent My Tent uses some of the information about his tent to suggest a sell price. Toby can set the price higher or lower than the suggestion but only within upper and lower bounds.

We can apply resale price maintenance to Rent My Tent because second hand tents lose significant value, partly because there are so many new tents being manufactured every year, an abundant supply entering the primary market (new tents easily available from retailers) puts downward pressure on secondary market prices.
