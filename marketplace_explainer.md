Whilst Rent My Tentâ€™s main proposition is a marketplace for tent hire, it is also somewhere for people who own tents to sell their tent.

The novel thing about Rent My Tent is that tents listed on the marketplace are firstly sold by their owners, the first transaction is effectively where the sale of the tent is matched with demand to rent it, and from there all future transactions involving that tent are rental agreements.

Renters pay to use the tent during a rental period, once that rental period expires they become the custodian of the tent until the next demand for it comes along.
