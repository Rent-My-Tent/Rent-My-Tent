### Competitors can be loosely categorised into three main groups

> Specialist Retailers | Online Marketplaces | Creative Initiatives

---

**Specialist Retailers** are the primary outlet for outdoor equipment & camping gear so they make up our first group of competitors.

The UK retail market is dominated by long-standing operators Blacks and Millets. In the US, 82 year old REI is the market leader, operating 158 retail stores in 37 states. REI also operates an equipment rental service.

When it comes to selling your used tent, **Online Marketplaces** like eBay and Facebook Marketplace are the first consideration for most owners. These marketplaces are very accessible to both the buyers and sellers of tents due to their maturity and familiarity. Buyers match with sellers, a sole exchange where used tents find new owners. Whilst we can assume that the seller had no more use for the tent and the new owner intends to use it, it won’t be used exponentially more, in fact it could easily be used as infrequently as it was before. We believe that you have to increase utilisation to drive down consumption, and that can only happen if you inspire less ownership.

Fat Llama's [rent (almost) anything](https://fatllama.com/) proposition has the most synergy with Rent My Tent. However Fat Llama has limited tent inventory - it's a new entrant and has no dedicated focus on tents.

The final group is made up of several **Creative Initiatives** who have designed their own unique way of restricting or lessening the impact of the festival-tent-abandonment-problem. These have all emerged in the last 5 years and some of these experiments have failed to become sustainable.

The interesting thing that the **Creative Initiatives** all have in common is that they are working in partnership with festivals.

Rent My Tent doesn't fit well into any of these categories. It doesn't sell new tents, it seeks to maximise the reuse of tents. It takes tents out of the normal means of ownership, many of the tents sold by the specialist retailers above will come into the Rent My Tent marketplace where they will always be up for rent. When a tent is listed on Rent My Tent its ownership status changes, the tent says “I’m no longer in a committed relationship with my owner, I’m open for rental.”

Rent My Tent stands out on its own; it's both narrowly focused on tents and has a novel "always up for rent" method which functions like a Deposit Return Scheme. Not only does this enable the environmental advantages, it clearly differentiates the proposition from both well-established online marketplaces and rental services.

The clue is in the name and of course renting is a novel approach. Whilst novelty can be harder to compute, the proposition is built on the principles of markets, and markets tend to reduce transaction costs. So novelty and markets come together to deliver a truly unique proposition.

Under the hood of Rent My Tent has a pricing mechanism that aids market forces. The incentives are baked in, driving behaviour and peer-to-peer coordination in such a way that the marketplace can scale quickly and organically - beside a business model that is sustainable.

To conclude, Rent My Tent is a novel proposition and has no like-for-like competition. The competitor analysis finds evidence - projects in the Creative Initiatives category - that the festival industry is ready for innovative solutions (and their eco-minded customers insist on it). This evidence informs our [partnership strategy](https://github.com/kelvinlockwood/Rent-My-Tent/blob/master/partnership_strategy.md).
